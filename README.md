# car_rental
An example project for the site builder.

Call 'mvn install sling:install -Dsling.mountByFS=true' to install to a Sling instance running at localhost:8080 and mount the files.
After that don't mount the file system again and only call 'mvn install sling:install' if you have non file system changes
